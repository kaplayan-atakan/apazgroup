# Sprint 8: Accessibility Improvements Summary

## 1. Navigation and Structure

- **Semantic HTML**: Updated components to use proper semantic elements (`nav`, `header`, `footer`, etc.)
- **ARIA Attributes**: Added appropriate `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby`, `aria-describedby` attributes
- **Section Landmarks**: Properly marked regions with `role` attributes where needed
- **Skip Links**: Added skip link component to bypass navigation for keyboard users
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Enhanced focus styles and tabbing order
- **Focus Management**: Improved focus trapping and restoration

## 2. New Accessibility Components

- **`AccessibleImage`**: Enhanced image component with:
  - Proper alt text support
  - Optional captions via `<figcaption>`
  - Long description support via `aria-describedby`
  - Support for decorative images
  - Proper role assignments

- **`AccessibleFormLabel`**: Form label component with:
  - Support for required fields indication
  - Visually hidden labels (maintains accessibility)
  - Help text connection via `aria-describedby`
  - Error message support with `role="alert"`

- **`SkipLink`**: Component to help keyboard users bypass navigation

- **`LiveRegion`**: Component for announcing content changes to screen readers:
  - Polite/assertive announcement modes
  - Auto-clear functionality
  - `useAnnounce` hook for programmatic control

## 3. Enhanced UI Components

- **`Footer`**: Updated with:
  - Proper heading hierarchy
  - Section landmarks using `nav` and `aria-labelledby`
  - Enhanced focus styles
  - Semantic lists with `role="list"`

- **`BrandTeaser`**: Enhanced with:
  - `aria-labelledby` for section relationship
  - Proper heading IDs
  - Role assignments for item lists

- **`HeroSimple`**: Added proper section markup and heading relationships

- **`Button`**: Improved with:
  - Support for icons with proper `aria-hidden`
  - Enhanced focus indicators
  - Color contrast compliance

- **`Container`**: Added support for accessibility attributes
  - `role`, `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby`, etc.

- **`Heading`**: Enhanced with tabIndex support for focus management

## 4. Layout Improvements

- **Root Layout**: Enhanced with:
  - Accessible announcement container
  - Improved document language handling
  - Meta viewport tag
  - Theme color

- **Locale Layout**: Enhanced with:
  - Skip link for keyboard navigation
  - Live region for announcements
  - Proper language attributes
  - Landmark roles

## 5. Utilities and Helpers

- **Accessibility Utilities**: Created utility functions for:
  - Color contrast calculation (WCAG AA/AAA compliance)
  - Luminance calculation
  - Focus style generators
  - Accessible field props helpers

## 6. Motion and Animation Accessibility

- **Reduced Motion**: Already implemented `usePrefersReducedMotion` hook
- **Motion Provider**: Connected to system preferences

## 7. Testing Tools

- **Accessibility Audit Script**: Implemented an automated script to detect common accessibility issues:
  - Missing alt text for images
  - Interactive elements without proper roles
  - ARIA attribute usage checking
  - Heading structure validation
  - Form control labeling

- **Motion Preference Test Script**: Created a specialized script to verify proper implementation of motion preference respect:
  - Detection of animation usage without reduced motion checks
  - Validation of proper CSS media queries
  - Analysis of Framer Motion implementation
  - Identification of transition effects without preference checks

- **Accessibility Testing Documentation**: Created comprehensive documentation for:
  - Running automated accessibility tests
  - Manual testing procedures
  - Screen reader testing
  - Keyboard navigation testing

## 8. Initial Test Results

Based on the initial run of our accessibility audit tools, we've identified:

### Accessibility Audit:
- 0 critical errors
- 21 warnings (primarily related to form control label associations and aria attributes)
- 36 informational items (including good practices like proper motion preference handling)

### Motion Preference Test:
- 22 good practices (proper use of motion preference hooks)
- 8 potential issues (animations or transitions that may need additional checks)

## 9. CI/CD Integration

We've implemented comprehensive accessibility testing in the CI/CD pipeline:

- **GitHub Actions Workflow**: Automated testing on every PR and push to main branches
- **Combined Test Script**: Single script that runs both accessibility and motion preference tests
- **PR Comments**: Automatic PR comments with detailed accessibility findings
- **Report Artifacts**: Test results saved as downloadable artifacts
- **Status Checks**: Accessibility status integrated into PR checks

This ensures that:
1. Accessibility issues are caught early in the development cycle
2. The team has visibility into accessibility compliance
3. Regressions are prevented through automated testing
4. Documentation is maintained with each PR

## Next Steps

- Address form control label association warnings in BasvuruForm and accessible components
- Add missing rel="noopener noreferrer" to external links in Footer component
- Verify all aria-labelledby and aria-controls references match their target IDs
- Complete color system consistency using Tailwind theme variables
- Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- Establish accessibility requirements for new components
